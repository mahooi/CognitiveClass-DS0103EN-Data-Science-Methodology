# CognitiveClass-DS0103EN-Data-Science-Methodology

a majority of data science projects fail, a whopping 80-85% based on Gartner research in 2017 <url=https://fastdatascience.com/why-do-data-science-projects-fail/>
a huge reason for that, i believe, is the failure in following a proven methodology and even more so a lack of understanding on the different types of data and the approaches needed to wrangle them.

For this reason, I am refeshing my data science capabilities from scratch, relearning about methodology from leaders such as IBM via their Cognitive Class self-paced course <url=https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/data-science-methodology-2> and mixing it with other resources and courses to ensure a fundamental understanding of different data structures, approches and methodologies for better data science
